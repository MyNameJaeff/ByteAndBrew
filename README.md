A full front & backend for a hypothetical coffee shop. 

## The javascript...
I have a bunch of javascript, i didn't want to have it but due to having issues with MVC i added a bunch of functions using javascript to fix it. I did this because i wanted one single dashboard page instead of a bunch of sub-pages as to make it dynamic for the admin.
